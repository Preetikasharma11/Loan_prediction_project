Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project predicts whether a loan should be approved or not using Machine Learning models.
The dataset contains details such as applicantâ€™s income, loan amount, credit history, and other demographic features.
Our goal is to build a predictive model that can assist banks/financial institutions in making loan approval decisions.

The project also includes a Streamlit Web App for interactive loan prediction.
